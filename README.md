cocos2d-x 3rd party libs
========================

This repository includes the source code of the 3rd party libraries (binary) that are bundled with cocos2d-x.

This repository is needed for cocos2d-x developers and/or people who want to:

* generate a updated version of a certain library (eg: upgrade libpng 1.6.2 to 1.6.14)
* port cocos2d-x to other platforms (eg: port it to Android ARM64, or Tizen, etc)
* generate DEBUG versions of all the 3rd party library


**Note:**

- We use MacOSX to build all the static libraries for iOS, Android, Mac and Tizen.

- We use Ubuntu to build all the static libraries for Linux.

- Windows is not supported yet

Other configuration were not tested. Compiling the Android binaries from a Linux
or Windows machine were not tested, so we don't know if it works or not.

## Download

    $ git clone https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x-3rd-party-libs-src.git

## Prerequisite
### For Mac users
- If you want to use these scripts, you should install Git 1.8+, CMake 2.8+, autoconf and libtool.
If you are a Homebrew user, you could simply run the following commands to install these tools:

```
brew update
brew install git
brew install cmake
brew install autoconf
brew install automake
brew install libtool
```
**Note:**
If you have an old version autoconf installed, you may need uninstall it first, then reinstall the new version. Directly upgrade to new version by `brew upgrade` command may cause build always failed.

- If you want to build static libraries for iOS and Mac, you should install the latest version of XCode.  You should also install the `Command Line Tools` bundled with XCode.


- If you want to build static libraries for Android, you should install [NDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html). NDK r9d is required at the moment and you should also specify the ANDROID_NDK environment variable in your shell.

- If you want to build static libraries for Tizen, you should download and install [Tizen SDK](https://developer.tizen.org/downloads/tizen-sdk). And you should also add a environment variable named `TIZEN_SDK` in your shell.

### For Linux(Ubuntu) users
- If you want to use these scripts, you should instll *autoconf*:

```
sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install automake
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libtool
sudo apt-get install git
```

- If you want to build 32-bit libs on a 64-bit linux system, you should install *gcc-multilib*

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
```
Then use command as follow to build 32-bit libs

```
./build.sh -p=platform --libs=libs --arch=i386 --mode=mode
```

### For Windows 8.1 Universal App and Windows 10 UWP App users
The build script for Windows 8.1 Universal Apps and Windows 10 UWP Apps is in build\dobuild_winrt.bat. In order to run the script you will need to install Git for Windows from https://msysgit.github.io/. During the install, make sure you select the "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" in the "Adjusting your Path Environment" step. dobuild_winrt.bat uses some of the binaries installed by Git for Windows. 

You will also need to install Perl http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads in order to build OpenSSL.

After dobuild_winrt.bat is complete, the built libs wil be in contrib\install-winrt.


### For Windows (Win32)

To build static libraries for Win32 is straightfoward, you could just setup a new static libary project with VisualStudio
and import all the needed source files and header files into the project.

Note: Some libraries use configure system to generate the required header files for Windows platform. If you find some 
header files are missing, please check the README file of the 3rd libs. In general, it will provide a VS project to 
build the static libs for Windows. Some libs also provide a CMakeLists.txt file, you could use CMake GUI tool to generate
a static library project. Don't forgt to Google the error messages when you can't compile the libs successfully.

### For Tizen Users
To build static libraries for Tizen, you should install Tizen SDK at first. Currently we only support Tizen SDK version 2.4, you could download Tizen 2.4 SDK from
[here](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tools/download).

Note: If you want to build static libraries with other Tizen SDK version, you should change `cfg_default_tizen_sdk_version` in `tizen.ini` file.

After downloading the SDK, you should also install the native packages with the **Tizen Update Manager**.

When finished the above setup, you should set a **TIZEN_SDK** environment variable to your shell configure file. (Normally .bash_profile for bash and .zshrc for zsh).

## How to use
We have one build script for each platform, it is under `build` directory.

The usage would be:

```
./build.sh -p=platform --libs=libs --arch=arch --mode=mode --list
```

- platform: specify a platform. Supported platforms: ios, mac, android, linux and tizen

  libs:
    - use `all` to build all the 3rd party libraries.
    - use comma separated library names, for example, `png,lua,jpeg,webp`, no space between the comma to select one or more libs

  arch:
    - use `all` to build all the supported architectures.
    - for iOS, they are "armv7, arm64, i386, x86_64"
    - for Android, they are "arm,armv7,arm64,x86"
    - for Mac, they are "x86_64"
    - for Tizen, they are "armv7"
    - use comma separated arch name, for example, `armv7, arm64`, no space between the comma.

- mode:
    - release:  Build library on release mode. This is the default option. We use `-O3 -DNDEBUG` flags to build release library.
    - debug:  Build library on debug mode. we use `-O0 -g -DDEBUG` flag to build debug library.

- list:
    - Use these option to list all the supported library names and versions.

### Build png on iOS platform
For building libpng fat library with all arch x86_64, i386, armv7, arm64 on release mode:

```
cd build
./build.sh -p=ios --libs=png
```

After running this command, it will generate a folder named `png`:

The folder structure would be:

```
-png
--include(this folder contains the exported header files)
- prebuilt(this folder contains the fat library)
```

All the other libraries share the same folder structure.

For building libpng fat library with arch armv7 and arm64 on debug mode:

```
cd build
./build.sh -p=ios --libs=png --arch=armv7,arm64 --mode=debug
```

### Build for Android arm64

1. Download Android NDK r10c+ and set the ANDROID_NDK to point to the Android NDK path. Don't forget to `source ~/.bash_profile`.

2. Make sure the `cfg_default_arm64_build_api` is 21+(The default is 21) and `cfg_default_gcc_version` is 4.9 in  android.ini config.

3. Pass `--arch=arm64` to build the libraries with arm64 support.

Note:
If you build `webp` with arm64, you will get `cpu-features.h` header file not found error. This is a known issue of Android NDK r10c. You could simply create a empty header file
named `cpu-features.h` under `{ANDROID_NDK}/platforms/android-21/arch-arm64/usr/include`.

### Enable bitcode for iOS
On default, when building static libs for TVOS, it will enable bitcode, but iOS doesn't.

You should change `cgf_build_bitcode` in `ios.ini` to `-fembed-bitcode`.

Here is the example code:

```
cfg_build_bitcode="-fembed-bitcode"
```

## How to build a DEBUG and RELEASE version
You can add flag "--mode=[debug | release]" for building DEBUG and RELEASE version.

## How to do build clean?
You could simply turn on the flag `cfg_is_cleanup_after_build` to "yes" in `main.ini` file.
After each build, you could also delete the generated folders under `contrib` directory.


## How to upgrade a existing library
If you find a 3rd party library has some critical bug fix, you might need to update it.
You can following the [README](./contrib/src/README) file to do this job.

## How to add new 3rd party libraries
Please refer to [README](./contrib/src/README)
